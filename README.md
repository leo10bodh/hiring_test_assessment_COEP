# Instructions:

  ## Clone the repository to your local PC:
  - git clone https://github.com/Tapas-Services/hiring_test_assessment_COEP.git
  - cd ./hiring_test_assessment

  ## Add your credentials:

  - git config user.name "Your_Github_Username"
  - git config user.email "Your_Github_Email"

  ## Create a branch:

  - git checkout -b "FirstName_LastName_RollNo"

  ## After you make changes in the `Questionnaire` directory:

  - git add .
  - git commit -m "Commit_Message"
  - git push

  - Note: You can make as many commits as needed. Your last commit will be considered final.

# The Test:

  - Use C, C++ or Python only

  ## Structure:
  - There are 3 programming questions in a pdf file in the `Questionnaire` directory.
  - You need to make sure that the program runs properly and gives correct output (No syntax, compiling, run-time, semantics error)
  - For all the 3 questions, the code should print the given input/output as in the pdf.

  ## Timing:
  - You will have 90 mins to solve them.
  - After 90 mins the repository will be made private, which means you will not be able to add more commits and your last commit will be considered final.
  - Keep updating your git branch regulary to ensure you don't miss the timeout.
